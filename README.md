Introduction to Robotics Homework 5, 3rd year at the Faculty of Matematics and Computer Science, section Computer Science at the University of Bucharest. This is composed by the classic `Snake` game recreated from scratch by me (Narcis Necula). Here you will find a detailed description of the game logic and parts as well as photos and a video playing the game.
